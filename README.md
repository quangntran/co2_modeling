# Modeling and forecasting atmospheric CO2 from 1958 to 2058 (CS146 Final Project)

Since 1958 atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements have been recorded at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. CO2 levels have been [increasing steadily since the start of the industrial revolution](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/greenhousegases/industrialrevolution.html) in the 18th century.

Older data are from ice core measurements, not atmospheric measurements. The data from Mauna Loa provide very direct data on atmospheric CO2, which forms an important part of global climate change modeling.

We will use the [weekly Mauna Loa data set](https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/assets/data/atmospheric/stations/in_situ_co2/weekly/weekly_in_situ_co2_mlo.csv) from the [Scripps CO2 program](https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/mlo.html).
